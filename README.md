VEHICLE DETECTION AND COUNTING USING OPENCV(Open Source Computer Vision Library)

#OVERVIEW
vehicle counting and detection and counting system. It will be enough to work for both the images or the video, for the same,
using OpenCV for doing all the image processing operations and for classification the Vehicles haar cascade classifier for detecting and counting Vehicles.
address a video-based techniques for vehicle recognition and counting based on OpenCV technologies.
The proposed technique uses the background subtraction method to discover forefront objects in video sequel. Several OpenCV techniques, including of an thresholding,
the adaptive morphology operations, and hole filling are later applied in the series of detecting moving vehicles more accurately. At last, vehicle counting is done by utilizing virtual identification zones.


#ABSTRACT

Vehicle detection and counting is very important in traffic monitoring, toll collection, military applications etc. 
The technology of vehicle detection in the captured video has implementation in a variety of fields. In this paper, we implemented a basic model of Vehicle detection and counting.
The video clip is taken as input, many frames are extracted, and background is estimated along with shadows.
The next frame is subtracted to detect all moving objects from the estimated background. From that moving object, vehicles are detected, classified and counted for traffic estimation using OpenCV, NumPy and object detection algorithms.

#INTRODUCTION

In this project, we detect and classify the vehicles on road, and count the number of vehicles traveling through two lane roads.
Weâ€™re creating a vehicle.py program that contains all the user defined functionsthat will be imported in the main.py program to detect, and classify vehicles.
Background SubtractorMOG algorithm is used which works based on Gaussian Mixture and help us inForeground/ Background Segmentation. Also used an OpenCV which is a real-time computer vision library of Python. Vehicle counting and detection system. 
It will be enough to work for both the images or the video,for the same, we will be using OpenCV for doing all the image processing operations and for classification.

#MOTIVATION

Vehicle detection and counting is implemented on python using OpenCV, it is used to improve the quality of intelligent transportation systems. 
A simple interface is developed for the users to choose the interested regions to analyze and then image processing techniques are applied to classify the vehicles and calculate their count.
